# Pool design genotype-based demultiplexing

Does the genetic composition of a multiplexed single-cell pool (which donors you
choose to pool together) affect how well genotype-based demultiplexing (demuxlet)
can tell them apart? 

## Pool construction

All pools draw n=8 donors from a "universe" of unrelated 1000 Genomes
individuals — either single-ancestry (`EUR_only`, `AFR_only`, `EAS_only`,
`SAS_only`, `AMR_only`) or multi-ancestry (`EUR_AFR`, `EUR_EAS`, `all_3_major`,
`all_5`). We derived pools using the following set of metrics

| strategy | objective |
|---|---|
| `random` | no optimization; baseline |
| `greedy_maxmin` | maximize the *minimum* pairwise genetic distance in the pool |
| `greedy_maxmean` | maximize the *mean* pairwise genetic distance |
| `greedy_maxkl` | like `greedy_maxmin` but using KL divergence instead of Euclidean distance (single-ancestry only) — **buggy, treat as unreliable, see `NOTES.md`** |
| `ancestry_balanced` | proportional sampling across sub-populations, no distance optimization (multi-ancestry only) |
| `adversarial_mindist` | mirror of `greedy_maxmin` — *minimizes* the pool's spread (worst-case floor) |
| `adversarial_family` / `adversarial_family_mixed` | a real 1000G pedigree (~50% IBD), padded with unrelated fill — a non-synthetic worst case |

Each cell (universe × strategy) has 3 replicates; the full design is 132 pools
(`txt/pool_experiments.txt`).
